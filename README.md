FoodHero is an application that allows organizers to donate leftover food after events. 

Using a Facebook Messenger interface, users can take a photo of the leftover food, and it uses computer vision to estimate the quantity of food left over, and how many people it can feed.

Users can chat with the Facebook bot which will prompt questions regarding expiry, dietary restrictions, and other relavant information. 

All the information is then displayed using a website, where charities and other non-profit organisations can view the available leftover food and request for it to be delivered to them.
